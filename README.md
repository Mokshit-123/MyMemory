# Tile Matching Game

Welcome to the Tile Matching Game! This is a simple and fun game where you have to find matching tiles in a grid. Inspired by the classic memory game from Purble Palace, this game challenges your memory and concentration skills.

## Game Overview

When you start the game, you will be presented with an easy level featuring a 4x2 grid of tiles. Your goal is to find pairs of matching images by tapping on the tiles. If you match a pair, those tiles remain revealed. If you do not, the tiles will be covered again, and you will need to remember their positions to find the match later.

## Features

- **Easy Level**: 4x2 grid
- **Medium Level**: 3x4 grid
- **Hard Level**: 4x4 grid
- **Settings Menu**: Change difficulty level
- **Reset Game**: Restart the game at any time
- **Star Repository**: Support the project by starring the repository on GitHub

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game to start on the easy level (4x2 grid).
2. **Match Tiles**: Tap on two tiles to reveal the images. If they match, they stay revealed. If not, they will be covered again.
3. **Change Difficulty**: Tap the three-dot menu in the top left corner, go to settings, and select the desired difficulty level (medium: 3x4, hard: 4x4).
4. **Reset Game**: Use the three-dot menu to reset the game.
5. **Star the Repository**: Use the three-dot menu to star the repository on GitHub and support the project.

## Future Improvements
