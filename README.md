# MyMemory

Welcome to the MyMemory Game! This is a simple and fun game where you have to find matching tiles in a grid. Inspired by the classic memory game from Purble Palace, this game challenges your memory and concentration skills.

## Game Overview

When you start the game, you'll be greeted by a start screen where you can choose your difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard. Your goal is to find pairs of matching images by tapping on the tiles. If you match a pair, those tiles remain revealed. If not, the tiles will be covered again, and you will need to remember their positions to find the match later.
